# quote-boxes

Whenever I read a book, I like to write down any quotes I find worth to remember, that's why I've created three boxes with quotes about happiness I really like. 
They are by Napoleon Hill, Nathaniel Branden, and Dale Carnegie.

"Happiness, the final object of all human effort, is a state of mind that can be maintained only through the hope of future achievement." (Napoleon Hill)

"One of the characteristics of immaturity is the belief that it is someone else's job to make me happy." (Nathaniel Branden)

"It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it." (Dale Carnegie)
